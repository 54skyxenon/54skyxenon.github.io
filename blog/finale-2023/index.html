Northeastern has a co-op program where upperclassmen spend 4-8 months working full-time instead of taking classes for a semester. But I need to graduate and start working full-time eventually. How does it all end?
2023: running from the ax! After months of being tested on algorithms, API design, culture fit, C++, debugging, distributed systems, full-stack web development, Linux, logic puzzles, network protocols, operating systems, probability, Python, SQL queries, and system design - it works out.

In DragonFable, you can opt to play in <a href=https://www.dragonfable.com/gamedesignnotes/broken-circuit-p2-8397>Adventure Mode or Doomed Mode</a>, which are easier and harder settings respectively. If last year was like doing normal quests in Adventure Mode, then this year was like doing the Inn Challenges in Doomed Mode.</p><p align=center><img style=max-width:80%;border-radius:3% src=https://i.ibb.co/Yc17WgB/doomed-mode.png></p><center><i>Doomed Mode in DF = higher enemy damage and HP</i></center><p>New grad interviews typically surpass the complexity of internship interviews, with an increased number of rounds and a more diverse array of questions. <strong>Coupled with the recession this year, they became insane.</strong></p><h3 id=the-beginning>The Beginning</h3><p>Compared to other graduating seniors, my situation was more comforting. I had a return offer from Duolingo as safety net should my other pursuits fail. The one issue was that Duolingo would force me to stay in Pittsburgh at a time when I was intent on staying in NYC.</p><p>The beginning of every past cycle has always sucked, and this year was no exception. After Duolingo ended, I scheduled an entire week of interviews with five different companies that I all ended up failing, which you can see here:</p><p align=center><img style=max-width:80%;border-radius:3% src=https://i.ibb.co/9bWZZ6m/first-week.png></p><center><i>I worried that my skills had regressed after this</i></center><p>In some cases, I could have just gotten rejected because headcount ran out before I could finish interviewing. This happened at Pinterest, where I both aced the questions and built rapport with my interviewers.</p><p>Past this, it was also tough balancing interviews with my internship at Meta as I had to take days off and work remotely excessively.</p><h3 id=the-remaining-faangs>The Remaining FAANGs</h3><p>In past years, I succeeded in the interview loops for Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft.</p><p>I seized the opportunity to apply to Netflix, in what was probably its 2nd or 3rd year of offering new grad positions. After sending in a good CodeSignal score (>800), I received a phone interview. Unfortunately, an honest misunderstanding during the interview about the question asked resulted in my application landing in the rejection pile.</p><p>I interviewed with Apple through cold DM&rsquo;ing an engineering manager on LinkedIn. After a tenuous interview with a team member who wasn&rsquo;t welcoming of Python, Apple was gone from my prospects now too.</p><p>As for Google, I was ghosted yet again even with a referral from my good friend <a href=https://www.lukejianu.com/>Luke</a>.</p><p align=center><img style=max-width:80%;border-radius:3% src=https://media.fourdayweek.io/files/which-is-the-best-faang-company-to-work-for-2022-GxCex.jpeg></p><center><i>So much for the remaining three...</i></center><h3 id=the-quants>The Quants</h3><p>Some trading firms have a policy where if you fail their interviews in previous years, you&rsquo;re blacklisted for a period of time. This got me immediately rejected at a few well-known places after reapplying.</p><p>One firm, Old Mission Capital, stands out in particular because it was my first and only physically &ldquo;onsite&rdquo; onsite interview. I enjoyed my all expenses paid trip to Chicago for a day, staying in a 4-star hotel and getting <strong>$$$</strong> meals by Millennium Park reimbursed.</p><p align=center><img style=max-width:80%;border-radius:3% src=https://i.ibb.co/1m9cg10/chicago-hotel.png></p><center><i>Chicago Trip #2, but free</i></center><p>The most formidable contender was Headlands Technologies, reputed to put candidates through a grueling loop of 10+ interviews. I faltered after about six rounds of intense C++ questions, but at least got an Uber Eats voucher for making it to the onsite.</p><p>Like last year, I struggled a lot with trading firms since I needed to understand lower-level concepts better. I took initiative and did this later by reading about <a href=https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/>operating systems</a> and <a href=http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/index.php>networks</a>.</p><h2 id=the-decision>The Decision</h2><p>During late September, I cold-emailed the new grad recruiter at Scale AI with my resume, earning an online assessment.</p><p>One technical and recruiter phone screening later, I happily scheduled a two-day onsite.</p><p>After what was about seven rounds of interviews, I received my first external offer by a thin margin - happily situated in NYC too! It&rsquo;s always amusing how receiving offers work, since right after Scale I received two more from Atlassian and TikTok.</p><p>I accepted Scale on the day my Duolingo deadline expired.</p><h3 id=hiccups>Hiccups</h3><p>All offerees were flown to Welcome Day in the SF office and it was a joyous time. That day, Alexandr Wang himself gave a <a href=https://heatonist.com/>spicy</a> Q&amp;A for us (with a LOT of almond milk next to him).</p><p align=center><img style=max-width:80%;border-radius:3% src=https://i.ibb.co/L1cRFJ8/scale-bar-meetup.jpg></p><center><i>Had a drink at a nearby bar in SF!</i></center><p>However, almost instantaneously, Scale <a href=https://old.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ywge5z/scale_ai_rescinded_ng_offer/>rescinded a new grad&rsquo;s offer</a> due to overhiring.</p><p>As the economic climate worsened, Scale resorted to a round of layoffs in January. Following that, the incoming NYC new grads were forced to relocate to SF in March.</p><p>I had no better options but to comply.</p><p>Despite this setback, my interview experience at Scale made me feel it was the right fit on my end as well, and that feeling was what I needed to end my new grad hunt.</p><hr><p align=center><img style=max-width:80%;border-radius:3% src=https://assets.website-files.com/5f6bc60e665f54db361e52a9/5f6bc60e665f5471cf1e5404_logo_scale.png></p><center><i>Until further notice, find me in SF!</i></center><p>My biggest takeaways this year were in figuring out what I was and wasn&rsquo;t a fit for. Even if I demonstrated adequate technical ability, <strong>some companies didn&rsquo;t feel like my interests were right for them without me even realizing it then.</strong></p></div></article></div></div></main><footer id=footer class=footer><div class=social-links><a href=mailto:bwliang.recruiting@gmail.com class="iconfont icon-email" title=email></a><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/bwliang/ class="iconfont icon-linkedin" title=linkedin></a><a href=https://github.com/54skyxenon class="iconfont icon-github" title=github></a></div><div class=copyright><span class=power-by>Powered by <a class=hexo-link href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a>
