So I wrote a script and cron job to close Spotify automatically and scold me every night at 1:30 AM, 2:30 AM, and 3:30 AM!
This is my computer systems knowledge coming to play! killall will send the SIGTERM signal to all Spotify processes running at the time, giving Spotify time to clean up so that essential operations can finish before shutting down.</description></item><item><title>&lt;&lt; System Announcement >></title><link>https://brandonliang.com/blog/system-announcement/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonliang.com/blog/system-announcement/</guid><description>Welcome to my world.

I got back into Yu-Gi-Oh! recently with the iOS release of Master Duel and have built three different decks for competitive play. The highest tier I&amp;rsquo;ve made it to as of this writing is Platinum I (after Diamond rank update).
Swordsoul Tenyi TODO
D/D/D &amp;ldquo;D/D/D&amp;rdquo; stands for Different Dimension Daemon. Taste the power of demon kings that have conquered different dimensions.
It&amp;rsquo;s an incredibly hard deck to master, and I still am in the process of doing so.</description></item><item><title>Co-op Duels: 2022</title><link>https://brandonliang.com/blog/recruiting-2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonliang.com/blog/recruiting-2022/</guid><description>Co-op Duels: 2022 Last modified on: 2023-01-21

Northeastern has a co-op program where upperclassmen spend 4-8 months working full-time instead of taking classes for a semester, this is how it went during my sophomore year. Some people opt for one long co-op, some break it up into two (me), and some even three.
I interned as a software engineer at MathWorks working on the MATLAB engine, followed by Microsoft working on the Azure cloud computing platform, respectively.</description></item><item><title>My First Post!</title><link>https://brandonliang.com/blog/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonliang.com/blog/my-first-post/</guid><description>I decided to migrate from my old website to a blog on the Hugo engine, since I feel like writing to capture my unconventional college experience. My university friend Josh also gave me some great advice to change to a minimalistic website as I&amp;rsquo;d get tired of the design less easily.</description></item></channel></rss>
