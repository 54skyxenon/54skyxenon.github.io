It stands for "Endangered Animal Species Tracker". Edge computing using drones is an emerging technology I wanted to try out to write such an application. Video footage is forwarded from a drone to an RCNN trained with transfer learning for live object detection on animals!

It's difficult for the deaf to communicate with sign language, but this becomes harder cross-culturally because each language carries its own set of sign language gestures. Sign Friendly is an Android app that translates between different sign languages.
