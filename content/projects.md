## Have a look at some the best projects I've done in my developer career!

### Sign Friendly
It's already difficult for the hearing impaired to use sign language to communicate, but it becomes way harder once you realize that each language carries its own set of sign language gestures. Sign Friendly is an Android app that aims to translate between different sign languages.

### Graph.Srch
Used the Neo4j graph DB to represent datasets of New England mailing addresses from 2005, 2010, and 2014. Our webapp produced insights, differences, and visualizations of the given data.

### COVID-19 Diagnoser
Gathers geographical, clinical, and personnel contact history data from users and estimates the user's risk of COVID-19 infection with a Bayesian model. The diagnosis also provides an action plan to users according to their risk rating.

### ML Snippets
I've written a few Python scripts practicing machine learning topics for my CS2810: Mathematics of Data Models course and during my 2018 summer internship.

### Google Flights Scraper
A scraper built in Express for Google Flights data using the Puppeteer library. Results are cached in a MongoDB Atlas instance for an hour.

### RelieveÜ
Inspired by Uber and AirBNB, RelieveÜ is a mobile app providing an on-demand private bathroom usage service.

### Parade Events
Parade Events is a mobile app serving as an events platform for Northeastern students. Working with the Parade Team, I made some fixes to the frontend UI and built a recurring events feature into the app.
