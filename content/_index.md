Hi -- I'm **Brandon**. I recently graduated from Northeastern University and work full-time now as a software engineer at **[Scale AI](https://www.scale.com)**. My first exposure to tech came through downloading a virus on my father's computer, prompting my curiosity... and the rest is history.

Throughout college and now, my location has changed roughly every season:

* #### 👨‍💻 (Currently) In SF, you'll find me riding my e-scooter around the Embarcadero and mingling at various tech conferences.
* #### 🌴 In LA, you'll find me practicing driving, napping, or enjoying a meal back at home.
* #### 🇨🇭 In Zürich, I might've been doing compilers homework in the ETH Polyterrasse or engrossed in an <u>[AIESEC meeting](https://aiesec.org/)</u>.
* #### 🦞 In Boston, I might've been studying brainteasers to prepare for interviews, or reading books during the wee hours of the morning in the library.
* #### ✨ In Pittsburgh, I might've been hoarding sparkling water from the fridge at <u>[Duolingo](https://duolingo.com)</u>.
* #### 🗽 In NYC, I might've been walking through Penn Station for my morning commute or auditing an evening class at NYU with my friend <u>[Jerry](https://www.jerrykjia.com)</u>.
* #### 🇸🇬 In Singapore, I might've been struggling to understand proofs in Real Analysis or grabbing a smoothie from the 300+ food stalls at NTU.

You can check out my CV [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VVj5t5a433gg2VThEKQqnLBPiqIumrXK/view?usp=sharing). Outside of work, I'm probably losing the Inn Challenges in [**DragonFable**](https://dragonfable.com), saving my Duolingo streak, watching SAO, or traveling.
