Hi, I'm **Brandon**, a third-year studying computer science at **[Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/)** 🇺🇸, living out my dreams. I recently finished a semester abroad in Switzerland 🇨🇭 and am co-op'ing remotely as a Software Engineer at **[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/)** ❄️! My first exposure to computers came through downloading a virus on my father's computer, prompting my curiosity... and the rest is history.

~~In Boston, you can catch me hanging out with other nerds at NUHacks or solving competitive programming problems at HCPC.~~

~~In Zürich, you'll probably catch me doing compilers homework in the ETH Polyterrasse or engrossed in an [AIESEC meeting](https://aiesec.org/).~~

At home, you'll probably find me listening to music, napping, or trying to fix my nosebleed.

When I'm not doing school stuff, I'm probably playing [DragonFable](https://dragonfable.com), saving my German 🇩🇪 streak on Duolingo, watching anime (especially SAO), or traveling.
