Hi, I'm **Brandon**, a senior computer science student at **[Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/)** living out my dreams. I did lots of software engineering internships at tech giants/unicorns last year and am grinding through my last semester of college! My first exposure to computers came through downloading a virus on my father's computer, prompting my curiosity... and the rest is history.

~~In ZÃ¼rich, you'll find me doing compilers homework in the ETH Polyterrasse or engrossed in an [AIESEC meeting](https://aiesec.org/).~~

~~In Los Angeles, you'll find me practicing driving, napping, or enjoying a meal back at home.~~

~~In Boston, you'll find me hanging out with other nerds at NUHacks, studying brainteasers to prepare for interviews, or reading books on the 5th floor of ISEC.~~

~~In Pittsburgh, you'll find me hoarding sparkling water from the fridge at work or reading a book in a random CMU building.~~

~~In NYC, you'll find me walking through Penn Station for my morning commute, auditing an evening class at NYU, or having a meal near Chelsea with friends I've made over the past few years.~~

In Singapore, you'll find me getting lost on NTU's campus or grabbing a smoothie from a vending machine.

When I'm not working, I'm probably grinding for Diamond in [**Master Duel**](https://www.konami.com/yugioh/masterduel/us/en/), catching up on [**DragonFable**](https://dragonfable.com) lore, saving my German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª streak on Duolingo, watching anime like SAO, or traveling.
