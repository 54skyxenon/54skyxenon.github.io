Hi -- I'm **Brandon** and welcome to my little corner of the internet!

I work as a software engineer at **[Scale AI](https://www.scale.com)**, currently based in New York City. What first prompted my curiosity in technology was accidentally downloading a virus on my father's computer... and the rest is history.

<!--
Throughout college and now, my location has changed roughly every season:

* #### 🗽 (Soon) In NYC, I'll be moving to the Long Island City neighborhood in Queens.
* #### 👨‍💻 In SF, I might've been riding my scooter around the Embarcadero and SoMa.
* #### 🌴 In LA, I might've been practicing driving, napping, or enjoying a meal back at home.
* #### 🇨🇭 In Zürich, I might've been doing compilers homework in the ETH Polyterrasse or meeting up with friends.
* #### 🦞 In Boston, I might've been studying brainteasers to prepare for interviews, or reading books during the wee hours of the morning in the library.
* #### ✨ In Pittsburgh, I might've been hoarding sparkling water from the fridge at <u>[Duolingo](https://duolingo.com)</u>.
* #### 🇸🇬 In Singapore, I might've been struggling to understand Real Analysis proofs, or grabbing a smoothie from a hawker stall.

Outside of work, I'm probably losing Inn Challenges in [**DragonFable**](https://dragonfable.com), saving my Duolingo streak, reading the Sword Art Online light novels, or traveling.
