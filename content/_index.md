Hi -- I'm **Brandon**. I recently graduated from **[Northeastern](https://www.northeastern.edu/)** and started working full-time in the Bay Area. I've done a bit of software engineering internships in school and I love learning about computer science. My first exposure to the subject came through downloading a virus on my father's computer, prompting my curiosity... and the rest is history.

College was a bit weird and my location changed roughly every semester:

* #### ðŸŒ´ In LA, you'll find me practicing driving, napping, or enjoying a meal back at home.
* #### ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ In ZÃ¼rich, I was doing compilers homework in the ETH Polyterrasse or engrossed in an <u>[AIESEC meeting](https://aiesec.org/)</u>.
* #### ðŸ¦ž In Boston, I was hanging out with other nerds at <u>[NUHacks](https://nuhacks.io/#/eboard)</u>, studying brainteasers to prepare for interviews, or reading books on the 5th floor of ISEC.
* #### âœ¨ In Pittsburgh, I was hoarding sparkling water from the fridge at <u>[Duolingo](https://duolingo.com)</u> or reading a book in a random CMU building.
* #### ðŸ—½ In NYC, I was walking through Penn Station for my morning commute or auditing an evening class at NYU with my friend <u>[Jerry](https://www.jerrykjia.com)</u>.
* #### ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ In Singapore, I was struggling to understand proofs in Real Analysis or grabbing a smoothie from the 300+ food stalls at NTU.
<!-- * #### ðŸŒ‰ In SF, TODO -->

Outside of work, I'm probably losing the Inn Challenges in [**DragonFable**](https://dragonfable.com), saving my Duolingo streak, watching SAO, or traveling.
