Hi, I'm **Brandon**, a fourth-year studying computer science at **[Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/)** living out my dreams. I've done a bit of software engineering internships around the tech industry and am grinding through my final year of college! My first exposure to computers came through downloading a virus on my father's computer, prompting my curiosity... and the rest is history.

College is a bit weird and my location changes roughly every semester:

* #### ðŸŒ´ In Los Angeles, you'll find me practicing driving, napping, or enjoying a meal back at home.
* #### ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ In ZÃ¼rich, you'll find me doing compilers homework in the ETH Polyterrasse or engrossed in an <u>[AIESEC meeting](https://aiesec.org/)</u>.
* #### ðŸ¦ž In Boston, you'll find me hanging out with other nerds at <u>[NUHacks](https://nuhacks.io/#/eboard)</u>, studying brainteasers to prepare for interviews, or reading books on the 5th floor of ISEC.
* #### âœ¨ In Pittsburgh, you'll find me hoarding sparkling water from the fridge at <u>[Duolingo](https://duolingo.com)</u> or reading a book in a random CMU building.
* #### ðŸ—½ In NYC, you'll find me walking through Penn Station for my morning commute or auditing an evening class at NYU with my friend <u>[Jerry](https://www.jerrykjia.com)</u>.
* #### ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ (Currently) In Singapore, you'll find me struggling to understand proofs in Real Analysis or grabbing a smoothie from the 300+ food stalls at NTU.

When I'm not working, I'm probably grinding for Diamond in [**Master Duel**](https://www.konami.com/yugioh/masterduel/us/en/), getting destroyed by the Inn Challenges in [**DragonFable**](https://dragonfable.com), saving my German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª streak on Duolingo, watching anime like SAO, or traveling.
