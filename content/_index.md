Hi, I'm **Brandon**, a senior computer science student at **[Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/)**, living out my dreams. I wrapped up a software engineering internship at **[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/)** and **[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/)** ðŸ¦‰ recently, and am currently at **[Meta](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/)** this fall for my final internship! My first exposure to computers came through downloading a virus on my father's computer, prompting my curiosity... and the rest is history.

~~In ZÃ¼rich, you'll probably catch me doing compilers homework in the ETH Polyterrasse or engrossed in an [AIESEC meeting](https://aiesec.org/).~~

~~At home in Los Angeles, you'll probably find me practicing driving, napping, or enjoying a homemade meal.~~

~~In Boston, you can probably find me hanging out with other nerds at NUHacks, studying brainteasers to prepare for interviews, or reading books on the 5th floor of ISEC.~~

~~In Pittsburgh, you'll probably find me hoarding sparkling water from the fridge at work or reading a book in a random CMU building.~~

In NYC, you'll probably find me walking through Union Square for my morning commute, sneaking into an evening class at NYU, or having a meal near Chelsea with old/new friends I've gathered over my years of college.

When I'm not doing school stuff or working, I'm probably playing [**Master Duel**](https://www.konami.com/yugioh/masterduel/us/en/) or [**DragonFable**](https://dragonfable.com), saving my German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª streak on Duolingo, watching anime (especially SAO), or traveling.
