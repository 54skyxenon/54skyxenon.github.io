> Welcome to my world. My name is Akihiko Kayaba. And as of this moment, I am in control of this world. I'm sure most of you have already noticed an item missing from your main menus: the logout button. Let me ensure you, this is not a defect in the game. I repeat... This is not a defect, this is how Sword Art Online was designed to be. You cannot log yourselves out of SAO. And no one from the outside will be able to shut down or remove the NerveGear from your head. 
> 
> If anyone attempts to do so, a transmitter inside the NerveGear will discharge a microwave signal into your skull, destroying your brain and ending your life. The transmitter signals in the headgear works just like microwaves. If the safety's disabled, it could fry your brain. Despite my warning, the families and friends of some of the players have attempted removing the NerveGear an unfortunate decision to say the least. As a result, The game now has less players than when it began. They've been deleted from both Aincrad and the real world.
> 
> As you can see, international media outlets have around-the-clock coverage in everything, including the deaths. At this is point, it's safe to assume the likelihood of a NerveGear being removed is minimal at best. I hope this brings you a little comfort as you try to clear the game. It's important to remember the following... There is no longer any way to revive someone within the game. If your HP drops to zero, your avatar will be deleted from the system. Forever. And the NerveGear will simultaneously destroy your brain. There's only one way for a player to escape now: You must clear the game. Right now, you're gathered on floor one, the lowest level of Aincrad. If you can get through the dungeon and defeat the boss, you may advance to the next floor. Defeat the boss on floor and you will clear the game. 
> 
> Last, but not least... I've placed a little present in the item storage of every player. Please, have a look. There's a high-density signal device inside the NerveGear rig. Right now, you're probably wondering, "Why?" "Why would Akihiko Kayaba, developer of Sword Art Online and NerveGear, do this?" Ultimately, my goal is a simple one. The reason I created Sword Art Online... was to control the fate of a world of my design. Kayaba... As you can see, I have achieved my goal. This marks the end of the tutorial and the official launch of Sword Art Online. Players, I wish you the best of luck.
