# New Grad Finale: 2023
Read the 2022 prequel [[here]](../recruiting-2022)

Northeastern has a co-op program where upperclassmen spend 4-8 months working full-time instead of taking classes for a semester. Eventually though, I need to graduate and start working **full-time** for real. So how does it all end?
