# New Grad Finale: 2023

Northeastern has a co-op program where upperclassmen spend 4-8 months working full-time instead of taking classes for a semester. But I need to graduate and start working **full-time** eventually - so how does it all end?

## The Application Process
> Applied: **74**

> Interviews/OAs: **30**

I've been playing a turn-based RPG called DragonFable for 15+ years now. In DragonFable, you can opt to play in <a href="https://www.dragonfable.com/gamedesignnotes/broken-circuit-p2-8397">Adventure Mode or Doomed Mode</a>. In Adventure Mode, all enemies halve their damage. In Doomed Mode, the enemy damage and health both increase. If last year was like doing normal quests in Adventure Mode, then this year was like doing the Inn Challenges in Doomed Mode.

New grad interviews typically surpass the complexity of internship interviews, with an increased number of rounds and a more diverse array of questions. **Coupled with the recession this year, they became insane.**

### The Beginning

Compared to other graduating seniors, my situation was more comforting. I had a return offer from Duolingo as safety net should my other pursuits fail. The one issue was that Duolingo would force me to stay in Pittsburgh at a time when I was intent on staying in NYC.

The beginning of every past cycle has always sucked, and this year was no exception. After Duolingo ended, I scheduled an entire week of interviews with five different companies that I all ended up failing, which you can see here:

Companies like Pinterest ran out of headcount so fast that I couldn't get an offer even though I did well on the onsite.

Past this, it was also tough balancing interviews with my internship at Meta as I had to take days off and WFH as much as possible.

### The Remaining FAANGs

In past years, I succeeded in the interview loops for Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft.

I seized the opportunity to apply to Netflix, in what was probably its 2nd or 3rd year of offering new grad positions. After sending in a good CodeSignal score (>800), I received a phone interview. Unfortunately, an honest misunderstanding during the interview about the question asked resulted in my application landing in the rejection pile.

I interviewed with Apple through cold DM'ing an engineering manager on LinkedIn. After a tenuous interview with a team member who wasn't welcoming of Python, Apple was gone from my prospects now too.

As for Google, I was ghosted yet again even with a referral from my good friend [Luke](https://www.lukejianu.com/).

### The Quants

Some trading firms have a policy where if you fail their interviews in previous years, you're blacklisted for a period of time. This got me immediately rejected at a few well-known places after reapplying.

One firm, Old Mission Capital, stands out in particular because it was my first and only physically "onsite" onsite interview. I enjoyed my all expenses paid trip to Chicago for a day, getting **$$$** meals by Millennium Park reimbursed.

The most formidable contender was Headlands Technologies, reputed to put candidates through a grueling loop of 10+ interviews ðŸ˜±. I faltered after about six rounds of intense C++ questions, but at least got an Uber Eats voucher for making it to the onsite.

Like last year, I struggled a lot with trading firms since I needed to understand lower-level concepts better. I took initiative and did this later by reading about [operating systems](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) and [networks](http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/index.php).

## The Decision

During late September, I cold-emailed the new grad recruiter at Scale AI with my resume, earning an online assessment.

One technical and recruiter phone screening later, I was invited to the onsite. During this time, [Grokking the System Design](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-modern-system-design-interview-for-engineers-managers) (and obviously LeetCode) were my goto resources.

After a two-day scrutinization of my debugging, system design, coding, and personality fit, I received my first external offer by a thin margin - happily situated in NYC too! I accepted on the day my Duolingo deadline expired.

It's always amusing how receiving offers work, since right after Scale I received two more from Atlassian and TikTok.

### Hiccups

All offerees were flown to Welcome Day in the SF office and it was a joyous time. I won't forget how Alexandr Wang himself did a [spicy](https://heatonist.com/) Q&A challenge with us.

However, almost instantaneously, Scale had to [rescind a new grad's offer](https://old.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ywge5z/scale_ai_rescinded_ng_offer/) due to overhiring.

As the economic climate worsened, Scale resorted to a round of layoffs in January. Following that, all NYC new grads were forced to relocate to SF. 

I had no choice but to comply. I made last-ditch efforts to interview with NYC-based firms like Hudson River Trading and Ramp when I was in Singapore my spring semester with no luck.

Despite this setback, my interview experience at Scale made me feel it was the right fit on my end as well, and that feeling was what I needed to end my new grad hunt.

My biggest takeaways this year were in figuring out what I was and wasn't a fit for. Even if I demonstrated sound technical ability, **some companies didn't feel like my interests were right for them without me even realizing it at the time.**
