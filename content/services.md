Do you need help applying to entry-level software engineering positions at top tech companies?

I've interviewed with dozens of companies in college in my 2nd-4th years, netted multiple great offers, and I can do the following:

## Mock Technical Interview ($40)
I give you feedback for a mock 45-minute algorithms interview and no-BS tips for practicing.

## Resume Review ($20)
We'll go over application strategy and make revisions to your resume.

## Both ($50)
In a 1-hour session, we'll go over both of the above.

[Email me](mailto:bwliang2001@gmail.com) with your availability if you are interested! Please note I cannot provide assistance above the intern/new grad level at this time.
