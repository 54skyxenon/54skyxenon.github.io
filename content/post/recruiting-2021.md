Northeastern has a co-op program where upperclassmen spend 4-8 months working full-time instead of taking classes, this is how it went during my sophomore year. Some people opt for one long co-op, some break it up into two (me), and some even three.

I interned as a software engineer at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/) working on the MATLAB engine, followed by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) working on the Azure cloud computing platform, respectively.

I learned about this the hard way last year, where I couldn't find an internship at all.

Embarking on a job hunt with no relevant experience *really* sucks, as most employers want prior experience even for internships in this day and age. A pandemic, a non-target school, and not being a junior doesn't really help either. But once you can break this Catch-22, it gets way easier.

For summer internships, be prepared to apply as soon as late July the previous year, when the current interns are finishing up. For NEU students, if you are just interested in a co-op, you can start applying once the semester starts. I do think it is better to start applying in the summer however just because you can devote more free time to interviewing before classes start -- I personally use the [PittCSC](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2022-Internships) GitHub repository to find job listings.

**My suggestion is do projects to pass the resume screen, then do [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) to pass the most common type of interview.** Apply with referrals if possible (helped me get an offer)! Many articles on Google can explain how to do those better than I can, so I won't go into detail here. One resource I recommend is the [Tech Interview Handbook](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/).

I got ghosted *a lot*, but from where I didn't, the first step to many applications were online assessments (OAs). These were a mix of automated algorithmic HackerRank challenges and behavioral HireVue prompts. I failed a lot of these my freshman year but found a higher success rate after intensive LeetCoding during quarantine.

The phone screens and final rounds that followed were actually easier. I enjoyed talking to a *human* and problem-solving in real-time after I had learned the [design recipe](https://htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/part_preface.html#part._sec~3asystematic-design) my freshman year.

In early October, I had received most of my offers and was exhausted from interviewing along with a huge credit load. I withdrew from my remaining interviews to focus on classes even as they were ramping up for other Northeastern students.

## MathWorks
The creators of MATLAB and Simulink.

## Microsoft
This company needs no introduction, although it didn't live up to the hype for me personally.
